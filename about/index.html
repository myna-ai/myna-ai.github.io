        <b>Why use Myna</b>
        <div>
          There are so many language learning apps out there, do we really need
          another one? We didn't set out just to compete with the already great
          options available. However, we found that many existing apps are quite
          pricey or filled with annoying advertisements. Is there a way to learn
          languages affordably while still focusing on the most important
          aspectâ€”learning by communicating? That's how we began brainstorming
          for Myna.
