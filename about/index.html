        <b>Why did we create Myna?</b>
        <div>
          There are so many language learning apps out there, do we really need
          another one? We didn't set out just to compete with the already great
          options available. However, we found that many existing apps are quite
          pricey or filled with annoying advertisements. Is there a way to learn
          languages affordably while still focusing on the most important
          aspectâ€”learning by communicating? That's how we began brainstorming
          for Myna.

        <b>So, how does it work?</b>
        <div>
          Most language learning apps today rely on popular language models like
          ChatGPT and Google Gemini. However, they process your data through
          their servers, acting as intermediaries, which is why they typically
          charge a monthly subscription fee. Myna, on the other hand, processes
          data directly on your phone and connects straight to OpenAI or
          GeminiAI. This eliminates the need to pay for middlemen. The only
          catch is that you need to enter <b>your own</b> API keys from OpenAI
          or GeminiAI.
        </div>

      <div
        style="
          margin-top: 30px;

          flex-direction: column;
          gap: 10px;

        <b>It's cheap, but how cheap?</b>
        <div>
          We have been rigorously testing the app using our API keys for the
          past few months. Multiple team members have been sharing the same key,
          and our total expenditure so far? Just $0.16! This amount may vary for
          different users, but it is unlikely to be significant. With a one-time
          payment of $10 to unlock all in-app purchases (no monthly
          subscription) and a few cents each month for ChatGPT or GeminiAI API
          usage, you can learn a new language for a maximum of around $15.

        <b>Myna emulates real-life interactions</b>
        <div>
          Myna offers tons of scenarios designed to assist with daily life, from
          ordering food to navigating public transportation. These practical
          interactions help you develop language skills applicable to real-world
          activities, such as small talk, asking for directions, or handling
          business meetings. By engaging with these interactive scenarios, you
          enhance your vocabulary, grammar, cultural understanding, and
          situational awareness, becoming a more confident and effective
          communicator.

          - Once you've downloaded the Myna AI App, you'll need to obtain your API
          keys. Fortunately, there are many tutorials available online that can
          guide you through this process. Here's one for OpenAi :

          - There's one more thing to set up: the keyboard. When learning a new
          language, it's beneficial to install the keyboard for that language.
          Once you have the keyboard installed, you can use iOS's built-in voice
          recognition to communicate with Myna. Here's how to setup a keyboard
          in an iPhone:
