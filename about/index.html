        <b>Why did we create Myna?</b>
        <div>
          There are so many language learning apps out there, do we really need
          another one? We didn't set out just to compete with the already great
          options available. However, we found that many existing apps are quite
          pricey or filled with annoying advertisements. Is there a way to learn
          languages affordably while still focusing on the most important
          aspectâ€”learning by communicating? That's how we began brainstorming
          for Myna.

        <b>So how does it work?</b>
        <div>
          Most language learning apps today rely on popular language models like
          ChatGPT and Google Gemini. However, they process your data through
          their servers, acting as intermediaries, which is why they typically
          charge a monthly subscription fee. Myna, on the other hand, processes
          data directly on your phone and connects straight to OpenAI or
          GeminiAI. This eliminates the need to pay for middlemen. The only
          catch is that you need to enter API keys from OpenAI or GeminiAI.

        <b>Myna is built to emulate real-life interactions</b>
        <div>
          Myna offers tons of scenarios designed to assist with daily life, from
          ordering food to navigating public transportation. These practical
          interactions help you develop language skills applicable to real-world
          activities, such as small talk, asking for directions, or handling
          business meetings. By engaging with these interactive scenarios, you
          enhance your vocabulary, grammar, cultural understanding, and
          situational awareness, becoming a more confident and effective
          communicator.
